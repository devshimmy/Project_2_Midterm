# Project_2_Midterm
This is a simple basketball game where the player is asked to hold spacebar to shoot the basket, the more one holds spacebar, the further the ball goes.
Anytime spacebar is let go, the ball will take action, even if it does not go far. After being on the ground for around 1 second, it will reset.
Note that you may need to click the sketch to play the game, it does not recognise your spacebar click until you do.
All art is made by me and inspiration from the link below.
